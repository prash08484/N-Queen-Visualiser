**N-Queen Visualizer** is an interactive web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It visually demonstrates solutions to the famous N-Queen problem, a classic combinatorial problem in computer science and mathematics.

---

## Features
- ðŸŒŸ **Visualization**: Step-by-step visualization of N-Queen solutions on a chessboard.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Dynamic Input**: Users can specify the size of the chessboard (N).
- ðŸ¤– **Efficient Algorithm**: Backtracking is used to compute and display solutions.
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## What is the N-Queen Problem?
The N-Queen problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means:
1. No two queens can be in the same row.
2. No two queens can be in the same column.
3. No two queens can be on the same diagonal.

---

## How to Use
1. Open the application in any modern web browser.
2. Enter the value of **N** (e.g., 4, 8, etc.) to set the size of the chessboard.
3. Click **Visualize** to start the visualization process.
4. Watch as the algorithm finds and displays all possible solutions step by step.
5. Explore the board to understand the placements and logic.
